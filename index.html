<h1>Nuclear Waste</h1>
<h2>Nuclear waste or radioactive waste is a dangerous squander 
    that holds radioactive material. This waste usually it's a product 
    of nuclear power remaining and other nuclear fission for medical use. 
    However, nuclear waste is organized by government organizations to 
    protect the human environment and its health.</h2>

            <h2>Energy Generator</h2>
            <figcaption>    
            The electric power plant nuclear reactor is also called nuclear fission
            the uranium 235 collides with neutrons and becomes highly unstable and 
            divides into two parts Barium 141 and Krypton 92 with 3 neutron particles, 
            which release high thermal energy and convert into mechanical or electrical form</figcaption>

            <h2>Nuclear Decay</h2>
            <figcaption>
                In nuclear physics and chemistry, radioactive decay is a result of 
                nuclear fission, in which the core of an atom divides into two or more 
                parts. this fission activity gives a result of gamma photons which by 
                itself is a large energy and it’s called radioactive decay.</figcaption>

            <h2>Nuclear Waste Management</h2>
            <figcaption>
                Nuclear waste is managed through various methods such as deep geological
                repositories, spent fuel pools, and dry cask storage. Each method is designed
                to handle different levels of radioactive waste.</figcaption>

            Exposure to radiation as a result of nuclear waste might have a direct impact
            on the human body for one-sievert energy (1 joule/kg) has the risk of carrying
            5.5 percent on humans to create cancer. Also, radiation is linearly to low dosages.</figcaption>

            <h2>The Discover</h2>
            <figcaption>
                This nuclear fission process was discovered by German Otto Hahn on December 17, 1938, and it
                was explained theoretically in January 1939. where he took the idea from the biological fission of living
                cells. With heavy elements nuclides, reaction can release large energy electromagnetic radiation as
                kinetic energy</figcaption>

            <h2>Onkalo Repository</h2>
            <figcaption>
                The Onkalo repository in Finland is a deep geological repository for nuclear waste. It is constructed
                in several steps and has enough space to accept fuel for 100 years.</figcaption>

               million euros and is funded through general electricity.</figcaption>

                Do not enter the storage; death will follow once you get the result of radiation.
